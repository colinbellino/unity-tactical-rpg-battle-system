# Tactical RPG prototype

This project is a really barebone tactical RPG i built to learn how to use Unity and to get back to C#.

Special thanks to [Jon](http://theliquidfire.com/about/) for his super useful series of unity tutorial (http://theliquidfire.com/2015/05/04/tactics-rpg-series-intro/)

## DISCLAIMER:

This project was built using an old version of Unity (5.4.1f1) and some unstable features (new input system at the time) and might not work on the newer versions.
